                    <p>Purpose of this project is mainly for my own learning of handling big data and data analysis in order to make a scalable, reliable and maintainable data driven application.

<h4>Project Aims</h4>
<p>I want to build an application that can data from wide range sources, and easily be able to query it efficiently to get both live and and historical data with minimal latency.</p>
<p>Businesses may have a lot of data from multiple different types of vendors, softwareâ€™s, and systems. They are interacted with in different, export and import in different ways and might not be able entirely useful or used to the best of their ability until they are combined with another system that again, might have an entirely different eco system.</p>
<p>Aimed towards industries like logistics, transportation, manufacturing, finances, where tracking live data and analytics across large complex systems are necessary.</p>

                    <p>Main concepts come from the **ETL** Process (Extract Transform and Load) **Lambda Architecture** by Nathan Marz as described in his book "Principles and best practices of scalable real-time data systems" in 2015.

<p><img src="http://localhost:8080/static/images/lambda-architecture.png" alt="Lambda Architecture"></p>

The main goal is for data analysts to query **any** data without needing to worry about timeliness, latency, accuracy, performance etc. and have a high quality reliable overview of data

Has 2 different layers, **Speed Layer** and **Batch Layer**, 1 layer handlining querying  historical data by storing all data and querying that, and the other handling any and all available appended data that is added.

Cons:
- 2 Separate layers are hard to maintain
- You would need incremental refresh of the batch layer due to full refreshes every hour being too hard to deal with
- Speed Layer is incredibly unreliable
- Very difficult to combine the results from Speed Layer and Batch Layer

<p>Main concepts come from the <strong>ETL</strong> Process (Extract Transform and Load) <strong>Lambda Architecture</strong> by Nathan Marz as described in his book &quot;Principles and best practices of scalable real-time data systems&quot; in 2015.</p>
<p><img src="http://localhost:8080/static/images/lambda-architecture.png" alt="Lambda Architecture"></p>
<p>The main goal is for data analysts to query <strong>any</strong> data without needing to worry about timeliness, latency, accuracy, performance etc. and have a high quality reliable overview of data</p>
<p>Has 2 Main layers, <strong>Speed Layer</strong> and <strong>Batch Layer</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Batch Layer</strong>:  is responsible for handlining querying  historical data by storing all data sources into one data ware house, and then analysts build queries against that data that refresh and selected intervals. (This is querying section is what the <strong>serving layer</strong> is used for). <strong>Views stored in a Postgres Database</strong>
<strong>Speed Layer</strong>: New data past the batch layer refresh interval in order to get live data. Views stored in a <strong>Redis cache</strong></p>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2 Separate processing layer</strong> engines which are hard to maintain. <em>Almost similar</em> code but enough differences that it becomes difficult to abstract and errors typical duplicate in both, making it very hard to debug.</li>
<li><strong>Needs Incremental refreshes</strong>, due to full refreshes being too intensive repeatedly. Makes the batch layer much more complicated. </li>
<li><strong>Speed Layer is incredibly unreliable</strong> since it doesn&#39;t last as long as the batch layer, meaning if a duplicate message is received hours later, it won&#39;t be able to tell it&#39;s already received it since having forgotten. This damages the accuracy of the speed layer.</li>
<li><strong>Combining results from both layers</strong> is incredibly difficult and requires some difficult computation.</li>
<li><strong>Speed layer is not as intensive</strong>, since compared to the batch layer, it can only take <strong>live</strong> data sources so streams from sensors. Getting live data from <em>most</em> sources is very difficult and requires a lot of work</li>

<p>For static files, for both incremental batches and reading from live data sources, it can depend:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can check if it has even refreshed, via the <strong>modified time date</strong> and version of the actual file, and if it hasn&#39;t it can been used regularly.</li>
<li>For logs, or files expected to only append, can keep a <strong>line offset</strong> and hash the data up to that point, so if the file updates and you hash that same amount of data, that data has changed and therefore anything appended is new that can be added (of course if the size of the file is the same, this is unnecessary)</li>
